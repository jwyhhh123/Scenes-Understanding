This repository contains code and supporting information relating to an architecture for incremental learning of state constraints for reasoning about and guiding deep architectures in determinig stability and occlusion of objects in scenes.

The file '.sp' gives a CR-Prolog implementation of the robotic domain representation used in the paper.

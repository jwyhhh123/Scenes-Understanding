This repository contains code and supporting information relating to an architecture for incremental learning of state constraints for reasoning about and guiding deep architectures in determinig stability and occlusion of objects in scenes, and for providing explanations about agents actions and beliefs. 

The file 'ASP_agent.sp' gives a CR-Prolog implementation of the robotic domain representation used in the experiments.

The file 'Lenet.py' gives the Lenet implemetation used in the experiments.

The file 'Alexnet.py' gives the Alexnet implemetation used in the experiments.

The 'Explanations' folder provides supporting files related to the ability of providing explanatory descriptions for the agent's actions and beliefs.
